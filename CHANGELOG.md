#### Api-Break

  - Initial release of ``django-pglock`` [Wesley Kendall, 731e0cc]

    ``django-pglock`` performs advisory locks, table locks, and helps manage blocking locks.
    Here's some of the functionality at a glance:

    * ``pglock.advisory`` for application-level locking, for example, ensuring that tasks don't overlap.
    * ``pglock.model`` for locking an entire model.
    * ``pglock.timeout`` for dynamically setting the timeout to acquire a lock.
    * ``pglock.prioritize`` to kill blocking locks for critical code, such as migrations.
    * The ``PGLock`` and ``BlockedPGLock`` models for querying active and blocked locks.
    * The ``pglock`` management command that wraps the models and provides other utilities.
